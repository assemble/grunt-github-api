This plugin requires Grunt ~0.4.0

If you haven't used Grunt before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a Gruntfile as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

    npm install grunt-github-api --save-dev

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-github-api');

Run this task with the `grunt github` command.

Task targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.
